"""
To monitor the performance of your model while training with an unlabeled dataset, you can use a validation set or holdout set to evaluate the model's performance on a labeled subset of the data. This will allow you to track the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss, and detect overfitting or other issues that may arise during training.

Here is an example of how you can use a validation set to monitor the performance of your model while training with an unlabeled dataset.

In this example, we load the dataset and split it into a training set and a validation set, define the model and its layers, compile the model, and then train the model using the model.fit method. We pass the validation set to the model.fit method using the validation_data"""
