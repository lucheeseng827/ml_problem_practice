"""
In this example, we define a MyTrainingAlgorithm class that subclasses the tune.Trainable class and implements the required methods for training. Inside the _train method, we calculate and record the training metrics using the logger.log_metric method provided by the tune.Trainable class. We then define the search space for the hyperparameters, create a tune.Trainable object for our training algorithm, and use the tune.run function to run the training. The tune.run function returns a dictionary of results, which we use to create an analysis object. We then use the analysis object to plot the results, compute statistics, etc.
