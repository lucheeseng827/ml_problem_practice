"""To send metrics to New Relic from a Python application, you can use the New Relic Python agent. The agent is a package that you can install in your application and configure to report data to your New Relic account.

Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow to send metrics to New Relic from a Python application:

Install the New Relic Python agent: You can install the agent by running the following command:
pip install newrelic

Configure the New Relic agent: You can configure the agent by creating a configuration file and specifying the required settings. The configuration file should be located in the root directory of your application and named newrelic.ini.

Start the New Relic agent: You can start the agent by calling the newrelic.agent.initialize() function in your code. This function should be called before any other New Relic functions are used.

Record custom metrics: You can record custom metrics by calling the record_custom_metric() function of the New Relic module. This function takes two arguments: the name of the metric and the value of the metric. You can record as many custom metrics as you like.

"""
import newrelic.agent

newrelic.agent.initialize()

# Record a custom metric with the name "Custom/MyMetric" and a value of 42
newrelic.agent.record_custom_metric("Custom/MyMetric", 42)
