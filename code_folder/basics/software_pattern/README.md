There are many different programming patterns that are used in software development. Here is a list of some common programming patterns:

Singleton pattern: A design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

Factory pattern: A design pattern that creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.

Observer pattern: A design pattern in which an object (the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

Decorator pattern: A design pattern that allows you to add new behavior to an existing object dynamically.

Command pattern: A design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Adapter pattern: A design pattern that allows you to adapt the interface of one class to another.

Facade pattern: A design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system.

Iterator pattern: A design pattern that allows you to traverse a container and access the elements of the container sequentially.

Mediator pattern: A design pattern that allows you to reduce coupling between classes by introducing a mediator object that coordinates communication between the classes.

Prototype pattern: A design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying existing objects.
