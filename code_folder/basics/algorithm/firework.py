"""Firework algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the behavior of fireworks. It is a population-based algorithm, which means that it maintains a population of candidate solutions and iteratively improves these solutions through a series of steps.

In the firework algorithm, the population of candidate solutions is represented as a set of fireworks, each of which has a position in the search space and a fitness value. At each iteration, the algorithm performs the following steps:

Evaluate the fitness of each firework in the population.
Select a subset of the fireworks to be exploded, based on their fitness.
Generate new fireworks by randomly perturbing the positions of the selected fireworks.
Update the population by replacing the exploded fireworks with the new fireworks.
The algorithm continues to iterate through these steps until it reaches a stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory fitness value.

Here is a simple example of the firework algorithm implemented in Python:
"""
import random

# Define a fitness function


def fitness(x):
    return x**2


# Initialize the population of fireworks
N = 10
population = [random.uniform(-10, 10) for _ in range(N)]

# Perform the firework algorithm
max_iter = 100
for i in range(max_iter):
    # Evaluate the fitness of each firework
    fitness_values = [fitness(x) for x in population]

    # Select a subset of fireworks to explode
    subset_size = N // 2
    subset = random.sample(range(N), subset_size)

    # Generate new fireworks by perturbing the positions of the selected fireworks
    perturbation_factor = 0.5
    new_fireworks = []
    for j in subset:
        x = population[j]
        dx = perturbation_factor * (random.uniform(-1, 1) - x)
        new_fireworks.append(x + dx)

    # Update the population of fireworks
    for j in range(subset_size):
        population[subset[j]] = new_fireworks[j]

# Print the final population
print(population)

"""
In this example, we define a simple fitness function f(x) = x^2 and initialize a population of fireworks with random positions in the search space. We then perform the firework algorithm by iterating through the steps described above, updating the population of fireworks at each iteration. Finally, we print the final population of fireworks."""
