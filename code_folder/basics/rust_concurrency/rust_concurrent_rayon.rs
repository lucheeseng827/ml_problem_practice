// Use the rayon crate, which is a data parallelism library for Rust. This crate allows you to easily parallelize the execution of iterators and other data structures using the par_iter and par_bridge methods. Here's an example of how to use the rayon crate to parallelize the execution of an iterator:

use rayon::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    v.par_iter().for_each(|i| {
        // Perform task in parallel
    });
}
