Matrix Multiplication: Implement matrix multiplication using multi-threading and GPU programming. Start with CPU-based concurrency using the std::thread module and then move to GPU-based concurrency using the rustacuda crate.

Parallel Image Processing: Create a program that applies various filters (blur, sharpen, edge detection, etc.) to an image using multi-threading and GPU programming. You can use the image crate for image manipulation and the rayon crate for parallel processing on the CPU.

Concurrent Web Crawler: Write a concurrent web crawler that fetches pages from multiple websites simultaneously. Use the reqwest crate for HTTP requests and tokio or async-std for asynchronous processing.

Parallel Sorting Algorithms: Implement parallel versions of common sorting algorithms like merge sort, quick sort, and radix sort using multi-threading and GPU programming. You can use the rayon crate for parallel processing on the CPU and rustacuda or ocl (OpenCL) for GPU programming.

Concurrent Data Structures: Implement concurrent data structures like queues, stacks, and hash maps using Rust's synchronization primitives such as Mutex, RwLock, and Atomic types.

N-body Simulation: Create an N-body simulation program that calculates the gravitational interactions between particles in a system. Implement a parallel version using multi-threading and GPU programming with the rustacuda or ocl (OpenCL) crates.

Fractal Generation: Generate Mandelbrot or Julia set fractals using concurrent programming techniques. Implement parallel versions for both CPU and GPU, utilizing the rayon crate for CPU-based concurrency and rustacuda or ocl for GPU programming.

Parallel Genetic Algorithm: Implement a genetic algorithm for solving optimization problems. Parallelize the evaluation of fitness functions and the genetic operations (mutation, crossover) using multi-threading and GPU programming.

Concurrent Neural Network: Build a simple neural network and implement parallelized training using backpropagation. Utilize multi-threading for CPU-based parallelism and rustacuda or ocl for GPU programming.

Distributed Computing: Write a distributed computing system that uses multiple computers to solve a problem in parallel. Use the tokio crate for networking and asynchronous processing, and explore serde for serialization and deserialization of data.
