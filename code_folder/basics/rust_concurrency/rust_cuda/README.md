Here's a sample Rust program that generates two random matrices, computes their dot and cross product using the CUDA API, and prints the results.


This CUDA kernel function computes the dot and cross product of two matrices. The dot product is calculated using standard matrix multiplication, and the cross product is calculated for 3x3 matrices only.

compiling file


 <!-- compile it to PTX format using nvcc: -->

```bash
nvcc -ptx matrix_ops.cu
```


This will generate a file named matrix_ops.ptx, which should be included in your Rust project. Make sure to update the Rust code to include the PTX file:

```rust
let module_data = CString::new(include_str!("matrix_ops.ptx"))?;
```


With these updates, the Rust program will generate two random matrices, compute their dot and cross products using the CUDA API, and print the results. Note that the cross product calculation is only valid for 3x3 matrices.



to build
```bash
cargo build

```

to run with cuda
```bash
cargo run --features "cuda"

# to run without
cargo run --no-default-features

```
