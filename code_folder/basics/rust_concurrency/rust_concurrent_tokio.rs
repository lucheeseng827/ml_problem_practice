// Use the tokio crate, which is a high-performance, async/await-based runtime for Rust. This crate allows you to write asynchronous code that can perform tasks concurrently and efficiently. Here's an example of how to use the tokio crate to run an async function in a separate task:


use tokio::task;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let handle = task::spawn(async {
        // Perform task asynchronously
    });
    handle.await.unwrap();
}
